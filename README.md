# Cronus

This Project was made for Apogee 2019 as a design system. It proposes a quadraped-rover hybrid system. It has 4 servo controlled legs to adjust the height of the chassis along with 4 omni wheels at the bottom. We have used a Holonomic drive system with Raspberry Pi as its microcontroller. We have also used a camera on the raspberry Pi to carry out motion detection, face and eye recognition using OpenCV.
The purpose of this project was to showcase a new design for a security bot with height adjusting omni directionality using a holonomic drive.

## Project

The 8 servos and 4 BO motors attached to omni wheels are controlled by the raspberryPi. The raspberry pi takes video footage and uploads it to a dropbox drive. The video is read from this dropbox drive and motion detection, Face and eye recognition is carried out on the feed.
